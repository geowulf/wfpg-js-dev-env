# wfpg-js-dev-env

I plan to put my js dev environment in this repository.

The topics when setting up a JS Dev Environment to consider are:
* Editors
* Configuration
* Package Management
* Development Web Server
* Automation (scripts)
* Transpiling
* Bundling
* Linting
* Testing & Continuous Integration
* HTTP Calls
* Project Structure
* Production Build
* Production Deploy
